Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

Many improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

// The following bugs have been fixed:

//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 3.4.0rc1:

* Nothing of note.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 3.3.1:

* The Protobuf fields defined as google.protobuf.Timestamp type of Protobuf standard library
  can now be dissected as Wireshark fields of absolute time type.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 3.3.0:

* The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.00.
  They previously shipped with Npcap 0.9997.
* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.15.1.
  They previously shipped with Qt 5.12.8.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 3.2.0:

* Windows executables and installers are now https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4472027/2019-sha-2-code-signing-support-requirement-for-windows-and-wsus[signed using SHA-2 only].
* Save RTP stream to .au supports any codec with 8000 Hz rate supported by Wireshark (shown in RTP player). If save of audio is not possible (unsupported codec or rate), silence of same length is saved and warning is shown.
* Asynchronous DNS resolution is always enabled. As a result, the c-ares library is now a required dependency.
* Protobuf fields can be dissected as Wireshark (header) fields that allows user input
  the full names of Protobuf fields or messages in Filter toolbar for searching.
* Dissectors based on Protobuf can register themselves to a new 'protobuf_field' dissector table,
  which is keyed with the full names of fields, for further parsing fields of BYTES or STRING type.
* Wireshark is able to decode, play, and save iLBC payload on platforms where the https://github.com/TimothyGu/libilbc[iLBC library] is available.
* Wireshark is able to decode, play, and save opus payload on platforms where the https://opus-codec.org/[opus library] is available.
* “Decode As” entries can now be copied from other profiles using a button in the dialog.
* sshdump can now be copied to multiple instances. Each instance will show up a different interface and will have its own profile.
* The main window now supports a packet diagram view, which shows each packet as a textbook-style diagram.
* Filter buttons (“Preferences -> Filter Buttons”) can be grouped by using “//” as a path separator in the filter button label.
* IPP Over USB packets can now be dissected and displayed
